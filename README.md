- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rubens A. Amaro Jr.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in numerical simulations of dynamics of fluids and elastic/rigid bodies.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on: computer simulation, meshless particle-based method, moving particle semi-implicit (MPS), fluid-structure interaction and hydroelasticity.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, please visit my [webpage](https://rubensamarojr.github.io/)
